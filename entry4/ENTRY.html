  <h2><strong>INTRO TO OUR THOUGHT</strong> </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Have you considered any of these questions?</li>
    <li>Why do we encounter thousands of plans and choices in life?</li>
    <li>What choices do I make when I am faced with a problem?</li>
    <li>Do we imagine or consider any factors when we are faced with a problem?</li>
    <li>Can the decisions we make and the plans we make be predicted?</li>
    <li>What are the best decisions and plans for you?</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>


  <h2><strong>PSYCHO-LOGIC TO ME</strong></h2>
  <P>

    When we think about a problem, we internally consider external factors and create assumptions about our behavior to deduce and choose a solution that best meets our expectations.I react differently to the problem in my life. These reactions are based on the<strong>social cognition</strong>I have.
    <br/>
    <br/>Sometimes I make a decision right away, and other times I struggle with it for a long time and can't even make a decision yet.My social cognition does not change dramatically in a short period, but the value of the stimulus affects my character in dealing with the issue.
    <br/>
    <br/><span style="color: rgb(214, 211, 216)"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cognition">Social_cognition</a>.is the process by which individuals make speculations and judgments about the mental states, behavioral motivations, and intentions of others.</span>

  </p>

    <br/>
  <h2><strong>PREDICT DECISIONS AND CHOICES</strong></h2>
  <P>

    In some cases, we can predict people's behavior by their attitudes. For example, when we minimize factors such as unexpected events in our lives, we find that certain behaviors that individuals typically exhibit are more likely to be predicted and occur. When a person's attitudes and beliefs are strong enough, that person's behavior is more likely to be predicted. Or when the person's attitude is closely related to the predicted behavior, then that behavior is also more likely to be predicted.

      <h2><strong>Q&A TO HELP WITH PLANNING</strong> </h2>
     
      To provide everyone who reads the site with a more detailed understanding of the logic of their thinking and the process of dealing with matters, some <span style="color: rgb(255, 240, 247)"><a target="_blank" href="file:///Users/zhengsirongserena/Desktop/core-1-interaction/entry3/link1_QUESTION/link1qusttion.html">hypothetical-type questions</a>. can help viewers organize their thoughts and think calmly about the problem.
    <br/>     
    <br/>
      Hopefully, you will be able to make decisions and plans logically and calmly. "Hot-headedness" is usually the most important reason why people regret their decisions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
     <h3>Know yourself, believe in yourself, and stop regretting your missteps.</span></h3>
